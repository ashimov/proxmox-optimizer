# =============================================================================
# Global Configuration Defaults
# =============================================================================
# This file uses "yes"/"no" string values to match existing script behavior.
#
# VARIABLE NAMING CONVENTION:
# - Legacy variables use "xs_" prefix (for backward compatibility)
# - New variables use "proxmox_" prefix with role-specific naming
# - Example: xs_fail2ban -> proxmox_security_fail2ban (in future versions)
#
# SECRETS:
# - Never store credentials here - use host_vars/ with ansible-vault
# - See documentation for secure credential management
# =============================================================================

# Global defaults. Use "yes"/"no" to match existing script behavior.
